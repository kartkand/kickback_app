3. Need a way to both: 
	- be aware of these spending "hotspots"- places and sellers- that get a lot of our business 
	- find discounts and promotions that can mitigate these costs 	
4. Our solution, Kickback, ensures that you'll be relaxed because it shows you a dashboard of your spending trends and identifies the places you buy at the most frequently. It then provides you discounts for either for that merchant or similar ones.
